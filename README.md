# Dish-It-Out

This is my capstone project I created during my 12 week Savvy Coders bootcamp.  This capstone project is a Meal Planning application that is broken into phases.  

The current state of the application is Phase 1.  This was all I could knock out while attending JavaScript bootcamp, working a full time job, and raising a family during Covid-19.  

Phase 2 will provide options for Printing, Saving, and/or Sharing the planned meal week so you don't forget what you're supposed to make.  Phase 2 will also be hosted via Netlify.

Phase 3 will provide more User Input to allow user to specify and filter meals that are more applicable to their health, diet, or whatever food category they may or may not be in the mood for.

Phase 4 will autopopulate a shopping list based on the recipes the meals call for.

Phase 5 will start carrying weight to the meals that are being planned.  That is, if "Caprese Chicken" was selected last week, it has less of a chance to be randomly generated again for the current week.

*Please Note: the application currently runs on local host.  Use "node server.js" in terminal.

Thank you for your interest in my application.
